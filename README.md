# Foxholm Financial: A Quantitative Registered Investment Adviser

Welcome to the public repository space for Foxholm Financial, a fee-only registered investment adviser serving Georgia tech professionals.

## Technical Background
Foxholm Financial evaluates investment strategies by favoring evidence over intuition and systematic discipline over emotional reactions. We build in-house risk models and quantitative analysis tools using an open-source tech stack centered on Python, Node.js, and cloud data infrastructure. This systematic discipline executes rules-based strategies backed by historical data to remove emotional decision-making from investment management.

## Student Fellowships
Building robust quantitative infrastructure requires exceptional talent. Foxholm Financial actively partners with university programs to offer specialized [Student Fellowships](https://foxholm.com/student-fellowships/). These Georgia-based programs provide students with hands-on experience translating financial theory into production code. Fellows contribute directly to our risk modeling, cloud infrastructure, and data visualization pipelines.

## Investment Strategy Guides
As part of our commitment to transparency, we publish open writeups of the investment strategies we research for our proprietary analytical systems.

Sharing this work reflects a core principle: investors benefit when the reasoning behind strategies is visible rather than hidden behind a black box.
